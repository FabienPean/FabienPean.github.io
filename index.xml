dynamic array: a dynamic array is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. [&amp;hellip;] A simple dynamic array can be constructed by allocating an array of fixed-size, typically larger than the number of elements immediately required. The elements of the dynamic array are stored contiguously at the start of the underlying array, [&amp;hellip;]</description></item><item><title>New paper published in Medical Engineering and Physics</title><link>https://FabienPean.github.io/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://FabienPean.github.io/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</guid><description>My paper titled Surface-based Modeling of Muscles: Functional Simulation of the Shoulder is now online !

After a long maturation time, it is finally online! :tada:
It was developed from scratch with Hugo, a great static site generator, and inspired myself or sometimes reused bits from the nice Academic theme by Georges Cushen. During the journey, I learned a lot about html, css and hugo.
Why from scratch? For two main reasons: one is that I had a precise design in mind, and the other was that I wanted to keep it as minimal as possible for my needs.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://FabienPean.github.io/home/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 18:50:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://FabienPean.github.io/home/about/</guid><description>Hello there ! Welcome to my personal website, I am currently a PhD student at ETH Zurich where I work on the musculoskeletal modelling and simulation of the shoulder.
In general, I am into by numerical methods and modelling approaches in the field of computational science, especially solid mechanics, with an accent on high-performance computing. My passion revolves around the interactive simulation of deformable bodies.
My interests condensed in a list:</description></item></channel></rss>

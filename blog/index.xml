This post goes over my train of thought from a barebone function to a richer interface, covering some common use-cases. For the purpose of this post, upload will be reworded as print, where the argument is output to the console. A minor change, but relatively similar interface.</description></item><item><title>Deep down the FOSS: an unexpected journey</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2023/04/deep-down-the-foss-an-unexpected-journey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2023/04/deep-down-the-foss-an-unexpected-journey/</guid><description>Once upon a VegaFEM It all began with a spark&amp;hellip;
On my spare time, I decided to sharpen my skills and change my mind by toying with VegaFEM, an open-source (BSD-3-Clause) middleware providing facilities for soft-body simulation in the realm of computer graphics. It has been developed by Jernej Barbiƒç and his group over many years, yet, it does not have an official release on any major git repository hosting websites.</description></item><item><title>Fastest heterogeneous container and benchmarks</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2020/11/fastest-heterogeneous-container-and-benchmarks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2020/11/fastest-heterogeneous-container-and-benchmarks/</guid><description>While doing some benchmarks with the heterogeneous containers described here and here along with some related containers, I could not but notice the performance of entt, more specifically its registry class which relies on a modified sparse set data structure. In front of such witchcraft, I decided to delve behind the curtains and see for myself the performance of an heterogeneous container based on it.
Sparse sets Sparse sets are data structures widely covered (1, 2, 3, 4).</description></item><item><title>A simple heterogeneous container in C&amp;plus;&amp;plus; without relying on 'variant' nor 'any'</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2020/08/a-simple-heterogeneous-container-in-cplusplus-without-relying-on-variant-nor-any/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/blog/2020/08/a-simple-heterogeneous-container-in-cplusplus-without-relying-on-variant-nor-any/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a precedent post, I outlined the implementation of an heterogeneous dynamic array.

dynamic array: a dynamic array is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. [&amp;hellip;] A simple dynamic array can be constructed by allocating an array of fixed-size, typically larger than the number of elements immediately required. The elements of the dynamic array are stored contiguously at the start of the underlying array, [&amp;hellip;]
Heterogeneous containers are data structures wherein elements can be of different types.</description></item></channel></rss>

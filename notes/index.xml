This document reflects my understanding and interpretation of the method. If you spot a mistake, please let me know !
Context Numerical models of physical systems are often represented as Boundary Value Problem, which consists of a Partial Differential Equation governing the domain accompanied by boundary conditions, known values on the boundary of the domain.</description></item><item><title>Dynamical system control</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/notes/dynamical_system_control/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/notes/dynamical_system_control/</guid><description>\(\newcommand{\T}{\mathsf{\small{T}}}\newcommand{\d}{\mathrm{d}}\)
Notations Let \(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{\dot q},\mathbf{\ddot q}\) be the generalized coordinates, velocities, and accelerations. The vector \(\mathbf{a}\) represent the controllable parameters, which are to be read as the activation parameters. The superscripts involving \(t\) will be used to denote time points such that \(\mathbf{q}^{t+\tau} = \mathbf{q}(t+\tau)\) represents the discrete value of \(\mathbf{q}\) at time \(t+\tau\), while subscript involving \(n\) as in \(\mathbf{q}_n^t\) will represent the value of \(\mathbf{q}^t\) at some iteration \(n\).</description></item><item><title>WTF C&amp;plus;&amp;plus;</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/notes/wtf-cplusplus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/notes/wtf-cplusplus/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this page, I enumerate various C++ fragments that sparkled my incomprehension when I encountered them, or made me scratch my head far too long.

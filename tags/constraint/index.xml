This document reflects my understanding and interpretation of the method. If you spot a mistake, please let me know !
Context Numerical models of physical systems are often represented as Boundary Value Problem, which consists of a Partial Differential Equation governing the domain accompanied by boundary conditions, known values on the boundary of the domain.</description></item></channel></rss>

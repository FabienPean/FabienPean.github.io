After a long maturation time, it is finally online! :tada:
It was developed from scratch with Hugo, a great static site generator, and inspired myself or sometimes reused bits from the nice Academic theme by Georges Cushen. During the journey, I learned a lot about html, css and hugo.
Why from scratch? For two main reasons: one is that I had a precise design in mind, and the other was that I wanted to keep it as minimal as possible for my needs.</description></item></channel></rss>

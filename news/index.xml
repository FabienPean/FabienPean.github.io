&lt;p>Entitled &amp;ldquo;Computational Modeling and Simulation of the Shoulder for Functional Analysis of Orthopedic Surgery Outcomes&amp;rdquo;, it was carried out at &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch">ETH Zurich&lt;/a> in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.balgrist.ch/">Balgrist University Hospital&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/philippefavre">Dr. Philippe Favre&lt;/a> from Zimmer Biomet. During my PhD, I developed numerical models of the shoulder to better understand the musculoskeletal system during active movement under various clinical conditions and their treatments. Thanks to everyone supporting me all these years and making this a reality !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New paper published in Medical Engineering and Physics</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</guid><description>&lt;p>My paper titled &lt;em>Surface-based Modeling of Muscles: Functional Simulation of the Shoulder&lt;/em> is now online !

After a long maturation time, it is finally online! :tada:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was developed from scratch with &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a>, a great static site generator, and inspired myself or sometimes reused bits from the nice &lt;a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic">Academic&lt;/a> theme by &lt;a href="https://georgecushen.com/">Georges Cushen&lt;/a>. During the journey, I learned a lot about html, css and hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why from scratch? For two main reasons: one is that I had a precise design in mind, and the other was that I wanted to keep it as minimal as possible for my needs. Site builder like Wordpress are huge with a lot of shadow places, but it can also apply to various Hugo themes, which can easily become difficult to navigate through.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

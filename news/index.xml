Entitled &amp;ldquo;Computational Modeling and Simulation of the Shoulder for Functional Analysis of Orthopedic Surgery Outcomes&amp;rdquo;, it was carried out at ETH Zurich in collaboration with Balgrist University Hospital and Dr. Philippe Favre from Zimmer Biomet. During my PhD, I developed numerical models of the shoulder to better understand the musculoskeletal system during active movement under various clinical conditions and their treatments.</description></item><item><title>New paper published in Medical Engineering and Physics</title><link>https://fabien.pean.pro/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabien.pean.pro/news/2020/07/new-paper-published-in-medical-engineering-and-physics/</guid><description>My paper titled Surface-based Modeling of Muscles: Functional Simulation of the Shoulder is now online !

After a long maturation time, it is finally online! :tada:
It was developed from scratch with Hugo, a great static site generator, and inspired myself or sometimes reused bits from the nice Academic theme by Georges Cushen. During the journey, I learned a lot about html, css and hugo.
Why from scratch? For two main reasons: one is that I had a precise design in mind, and the other was that I wanted to keep it as minimal as possible for my needs.</description></item></channel></rss>
